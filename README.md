 - [x] APIs REST
 - [x] Elasticsearch, MongoDB
 - [x] Data Visualization and Evaluating
 - [x] Machine and Deep Learnig Libs
	 - [x] keras, tensorflow, pytorch, Scikit-learning
	 - [x] NLPK, LSTM, RNN, GRU
	 - [x] A little bit about XGBoost and PyBrain

**Statistics:** 
 - [x] Prediction, classification, descriptive, uncertainty, sampling, probability
 - [x] Time series forecasting, Logistic Regression, ARIMA and others

## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Single backticks|`'Isn't this fun?'`            |'Isn't this fun?'            |
|Quotes          |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
|Dashes          |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|


## Precision

$$
Precision = TP/TP+FP
$$
$$
Recall = TP/TP+FN
$$

> You can find more information about **Precision and Recall** mathematical expressions [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall).

And this will produce a flow chart:

A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
```
